# Simon-Game

 - Simon is an electronic memory game that tests and challenges players' ability to remember and repeat sequences of colors and sounds. The game is named after its inventor, Ralph H. Baer's son, and it was first released in the late 1970s. Over the years, it has become a classic and popular game for all ages.

 ### Description:
 - The Simon game consists of a round, plastic console with four large colored buttons, each emitting a distinct musical tone and lighting up when pressed. The console also has a small display that shows the current score and the sequences the player needs to follow. The game is known for its simple yet addictive gameplay, providing hours of entertainment and mental stimulation.


# Rules: 

 - The game begins with a short sequence, typically two to three colors and sounds, played by the console. Each color corresponds to a button on the console.

-  After the sequence is played, the player must repeat it back by pressing the buttons in the exact order they were shown. For example, if the sequence was "Red - Green - Blue," the player must press the buttons in that order.

- If the player successfully repeats the sequence, the console will add one more step to the sequence and play it again. The player's task is to keep remembering and correctly reproducing the growing sequence.

-  The game continues to add one step to the sequence each time the player successfully replicates it. The longer the game goes on, the more challenging it becomes as the sequences become more complex and harder to remember.

- If the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or pressing them in the wrong order, the game will end, and the player's score will be displayed.
 
- The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by correctly repeating the longest sequence of colors and sounds.

- Some variations of Simon may have additional modes or features, but the core gameplay always involves remembering and reproducing sequences of colors and sounds.
